# stock_market_forecasting

The stock market is a complex and dynamic environment where traders and investors strive to make informed decisions to maximize their returns. Predicting stock prices accurately is a challenging task due to the multitude of factors influencing the market. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promise in forecasting stock prices. This project aims to develop a Stock Market Forecasting system using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is known for its ability to capture sequential dependencies in time series data.

Project Objectives:
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Collection: Gather historical stock price data for one or more selected stocks or market indices. This data will serve as the training and testing dataset for the LSTM model.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and preprocess the collected data to make it suitable for training the LSTM model. This may involve handling missing values, scaling data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture: Design a Stacked LSTM model with multiple LSTM layers. Stacking LSTM layers can improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data.

Training: Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data. Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM layers, the number of neurons in each layer, batch size, and learning rate, to optimize model performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Compare the model's predictions against actual stock prices to assess its accuracy.

Visualization: Create visualizations, such as line plots or candlestick charts, to visualize the model's predictions and compare them with actual stock price movements.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to further improve its performance.

Deployment: If applicable, deploy the trained model as a web application or API that allows users to input stock symbols or indices and receive short-term and long-term price forecasts.

Expected Deliverables:

A well-documented Python codebase that includes data collection, preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation.
A report or Jupyter notebook detailing the project methodology, results, and insights.
Visualizations and plots showcasing the model's predictions.
A deployed application or API (if applicable).
sist traders and investors in making more informed decisions in the stock market. Additionally, it provides valuable experience in working with time series data and deep learning models.
